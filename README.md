 This project explores the implementation and evaluation of various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies, including Tesseract OCR, OCR.Space, Azure OCR,
 Google Cloud OCR, and AWS Textract. The objective is to analyze their performance in extracting textual data from
 images, focusing on accuracy, processing speed, and cost
effectiveness. Each service is examined based on its processing type, supported formats, and pricing structure. The
 analysis aims to provide insights into the strengths and
 weaknesses of each solution, guiding users in selecting the
 most appropriate OCR tool for their specific needs. Special
 emphasis is placed on accuracy comparisons using data
 from a variety of sources. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the state of the art OCR services capabilities in various application scenarios, such as document
 digitization, text recognition in natural scene images, automated data entry from handwritten documents, and multilingual recognition.
