 This project explores the implementation and evaluation
 of various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technolo
gies, including Tesseract OCR, OCR.Space, Azure OCR,
 Google Cloud OCR, and AWS Textract. The objective is
 to analyze their performance in extracting textual data from
 images, focusing on accuracy, processing speed, and cost
effectiveness. Each service is examined based on its pro
cessing type, supported formats, and pricing structure. The
 analysis aims to provide insights into the strengths and
 weaknesses of each solution, guiding users in selecting the
 most appropriate OCR tool for their specific needs. Special
 emphasis is placed on accuracy comparisons using data
 from a variety of sources. The findings contribute to a bet
ter understanding of the state of the art OCR services capa
bilities in various application scenarios, such as document
 digitization, text recognition in natural scene images, auto
mated data entry from handwritten documents, and multi
lingual recognition.
